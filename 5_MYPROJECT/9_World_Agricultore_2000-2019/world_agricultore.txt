Hypotheses are put forward that the effect of cattle breeding on global warming is far beyond what is known.
In addition, those who raised the same issue also began to examine the issue of famine.
The subject intrigued me and I wanted to examine it.
I divided my work into 3 parts;
   1. First Part; Exploratory Data Analysis.
   2. Second Part; Data Visualization.
   3. Third Part; Machine Learning Algorithm
I hope you enjoy.
